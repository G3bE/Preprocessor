## Questions and help
If you need help... You won't need any it's friggin' defines.

Q: Is this a serious project<br>
A: No, it's obviously a meme

Q: Updates?<br>
A: Maybe. Feel free to add some shit via PR's

Q: When should I use this?<br>
A: ~~Never. Using this is a shit idea. It uses fucking void pointers for every single variable.~~ As there are no weird void pointers anymore and I made pretty nice error outputs, this may actually be usable. Try it if you are familiar with C and aware that this can and probably will cause cancer somewhere in your body.

Q: Can I use this without Xcode?<br>
A: Of course. Its maybe even easier. Just put all the header files from this project in some nice location and add it as an include folder.

Q: I got another question!<br>
A: Good for your. Bake yourself an icecream!
